# Code examples
When I help people with a coding problem I usually create a tiny little project showing them how to do it. 
These projects will be made available to them (and others) here :)

# Warning
Most of the code will be decent but there is some beginner stuff in here too :)
If you want to evaluate my coding standards I suggest you'd take a look at "Java/Design patterns" or my other repositories.
